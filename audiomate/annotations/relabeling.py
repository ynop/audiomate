    Relabel an entire :py:class:`~audiomate.annotations.LabelList` using user-defined projections.

    You can define one projection per line. Each projection starts with a list of one or multiple
    old labels (separated by a single whitespace) that are separated from the new label by a pipe
    (`|`). In the code above, the segment labeled with `old_label_1` will be labeled with
    `new_label_1` after applying the projection. Segments that are labeled with `old_label_1`
    **and** `old_label_2` concurrently are relabeled to `new_label_2`. All segments labeled with
    `old_label_3` are dropped. Combinations of multiple labels are automatically sorted in natural
    order.
